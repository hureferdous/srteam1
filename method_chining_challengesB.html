				   <p > Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site. As a 
				   result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. 
				   Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it,
				   it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
